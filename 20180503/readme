Learning from imbalanced data

Imbalanced data is a frequently occurring problem. For instance in fraud detection, most transactions are not fraudulent. When 
detecting genes in DNA sequences, most DNA is not coding for a gene. Similar problems occur in the insurance business or web traffic 
analytics. Machine learning from imbalanced classes is challenging because standard metrics can give counterintuitive results. Some
of our favourite ML tools won't work as expected.

In this meeting of the London Data Science Journal club, we won't focus on a single paper but work together in small groups.
Each group will pick a particular algorithm, metric or software. Towards the end of the meetup, we will get together again to 
discuss our results.

Below are some literature references to get started, but please do come along and tell us about your own experiences:
